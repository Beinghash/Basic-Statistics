# 📊 Data Analysis Series – Basic Statistics – Real Case Study Projects
Series: Data Analysis Projects
Level: Beginner-friendly | 📁 Python | 🧮 Statistics | 📈 Data Analysis

This repository contains hands-on project notes and code implementations based on real-world datasets, aimed at helping beginners understand basic statistical concepts through practical data analysis.

# 🧩 Part 1: Measures of Central Tendency – Wine Quality Dataset
📂 File Included: Measure_of_Central_Tendency_Project.ipynb
📊 Dataset: Wine Quality Dataset.csv

In this project, we explore central tendency concepts (mean, median, and mode) using the Wine Quality dataset.

Tasks:
Task 1: Load and Study the Data

Understand the structure, columns, and general characteristics of the wine dataset.

Task 2: Visualize Distributions & Calculate Central Tendencies

Create visualizations using histogram, distplot, and countplot to explore the distributions of features.

Compute mean, median, and mode of key variables.

Task 3: Acid Type Analysis by Quality

Construct a new pandas Series to analyze different acid types grouped by wine quality.

# 📊 Part 2: Descriptive Statistics – Employee Dataset Case Study
📂 File Included: Descriptive_Statistics_Case_Study_Project.ipynb
📊 Dataset: Employee Dataset.csv

This part dives deeper into descriptive statistical techniques and enhances the analysis with data visualization.

Key Highlights:
Use of histograms, scatter plots, and other visual techniques to summarize and explore employee-related data.

Extract insights such as variability, spread, and relationships between features.

✅ Key Skills Practiced:
Data cleaning & exploration with Pandas

Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Statistical understanding of mean, median, mode, and distribution

Extracting and interpreting patterns from real datasets
